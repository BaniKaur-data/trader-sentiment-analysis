##  Project Overview

This project explores the relationship between crypto trader activity and overall market sentiment using the Fear & Greed Index.

The goal was to understand whether trader behavior (trading volume, win rate, and profitability) changes under different market sentiment conditions.

---

##  Datasets Used

### 1. Historical Trader Data
- Trade-level activity  
- PnL and position information  
- Buy/Sell behavior  

### 2. Fear & Greed Index
- Daily market sentiment classification  
- Sentiment score values  

---

##  Key Steps Performed

- Data cleaning and preprocessing  
- Timestamp standardization  
- Daily trader metrics aggregation  
- Merging trader data with sentiment data  
- Exploratory data analysis and visualization  
- Simple classification model for sentiment prediction  

---

##  Key Insights

- Trading activity appears higher during extreme fear periods  
- Win rate shows moderate variation across sentiment regimes  
- Profitability differs across market sentiment conditions  
- The simple model achieved modest accuracy in predicting sentiment  

---

##  Limitations

- Analysis is based on aggregated daily data  
- Limited overlap between trader activity and sentiment dates  
- Model performance is constrained by small sample size  
- Results should be interpreted as exploratory, not predictive  

---

##  Tech Stack

- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  
- Scikit-learn
